											<h2>Principles, practices, policies, and procedures</h2>
											<div class="ibm-container-body">
												<p>
													<strong>Integrity and ethical standards:</strong><br /> It
													is IBM's policy to conduct itself ethically and fairly in
													relation to its suppliers and all others with whom IBM does
													business. If, at any time, this policy is perceived as
													being compromised in any way, please report your concern to
													the <a
														href="United+States~Ombudsman-Supplier+relations?OpenDocument&Parent=Policies+and+procedures"
														onmouseover="window.status='IBM Global Procurement Ombudsman'; return true"
														onmouseout="window.status=' '">IBM Global Procurement
														Ombudsman</a> (800-233-3073). Concerns will be addressed
													promptly with care, respect, and confidentiality.
												</p>
												<p>
													<strong>Reciprocity:</strong><br /> IBM's goal is to buy
													goods and services which have the best prices, quality,
													delivery, and technology. IBM has a policy against
													reciprocal buying arrangements, because those arrangements
													can interfere with this goal.
												</p>
												<p>
													<strong>Confidentiality:</strong><br /> IBM considers its
													business relationships with each of its suppliers and
													potential suppliers to be a private matter between the two
													parties. IBM will treat information received from suppliers
													in a responsible fashion and expects suppliers to treat
													information received from IBM in the same manner. Further,
													IBM does not wish to receive from a supplier any
													information which is considered to be confidential unless
													the supplier and IBM have entered into a confidential
													disclosure agreement which covers such information.
												</p>
												<p>
													<strong>Patents:</strong><br /> IBM does not knowingly
													infringe the patent rights of others. Conversely, IBM
													requires patent indemnification on all procured materials.
													IBM will discuss ideas or inventions with outside
													individuals and, where necessary, will contract for the
													development of special products. In all such cases,
													appropriate contractual arrangements must be made in
													advance.
												</p>
												<p>
													<strong>Supplier diversity program:</strong><br /> IBM
													maintains a commitment to ensure a diverse supplier base.
													It is our policy to provide opportunities in all areas of
													IBM's procurement, marketing and contracting activities to
													people of different ethnic origins, women, people with
													disabilities, etc.
												</p>
												<p>
													<strong>Gifts and gratuities:</strong><br /> IBM employees
													and members of their families may not solicit or accept
													gratuities from suppliers or prospective suppliers. Only
													gifts of $50 or less can be accepted by employees.
												</p>
												<p>
													<strong>Business meals and entertainment:</strong><br />
													IBM employees who deal with suppliers may accept customary
													business amenities such as meals and entertainment,
													provided the expenses involved are kept at a reasonable
													level and are not prohibited by law or known supplier
													business practices. IBM employees are expected to
													reciprocate and share these costs equally over time.
												</p>
												<p>
													<strong>Appropriate conduct on IBM premises:</strong><br />
													All individuals on IBM premises are expected to engage in
													appropriate conduct and behave in a business-like manner.
													Examples of inappropriate conduct are being under the
													influence of or affected by alcohol; use of illegal drugs;
													use of a controlled substance, except for approved medical
													purposes; possession of a weapon of any sort; and/or
													harassment threats or violent behavior.
